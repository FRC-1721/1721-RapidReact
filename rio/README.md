# Pipenv

Pipenv is a useful tool for controlling package versions, it assures we all have the same packages and is much like a requirements.txt but stricter.

To get started, activate this project

```shell
$ cd src
$ pipenv install
$ pipenv shell
```

Make sure you can run the simulator

```shell
$ python robot.py sim
```
