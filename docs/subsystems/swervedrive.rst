  A prototype swerve drive module

This year's robot is very novel due to the implementation of Swerve Drive,
we have never attempted this before so it came with its own challenges and hardships.

A key moment in demonstrating the challenges we faced when attempting to program the
Swerve Drive we burnt out a Neo 550 we were using to test the code.
