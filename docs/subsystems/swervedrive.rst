This year's robot is very novel due to the implementation of Swerve Drive,
we have never attempted this before so it came with its own challenges and hardships.

A key moment in demonstrating the challenges we faced when attempting to program the
Swerve Drive we burnt out a Neo 550 we were using to test the code.
